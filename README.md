# Hordijk Manual 2020

I placed an order for a Hordijk Modular System in February 2019. 18
months later, September 2020, I received a "standard" Hordijk Modular
System. Unlike earlier versions of the system, it came fully black. As
far as I am I aware, there are only five such systems with matching
black cases in existence. My friend Clint Newsom has one of them. Rob
built less than 100 modular systems in total.

After placing the order, Hordijk sent the following PDFs describing
the various aspects of his system. These aren't readily available
online so I've collected them here.
